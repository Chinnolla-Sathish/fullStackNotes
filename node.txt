Node.js

-- Node.js is basically asynchronus event - driven javaruntime, node.js is actually
build for network applicatioins.

why node.js we have other backends also python,ruby,php etc  ?

-- it is because we develop frontend using react.js or html,css,javascript so if use
node.js as a backend then the entire application would be in one language that is 
javascript that is the reason we mainly use node.js as a backend.


----------------------- USING NATIVE MODULES --------------------------------- lecture 196 { npm init and use of modules,package.json[configuration file for our project]}
const fs = require("fs"); fs is used to reading and writing file.
Native modules search in google ,we can use by importing or require("module_name");

CSJ --- it uses require method to import modules to our project
ESM --- it uses import keyword to import modules to our project
----------------------- USING NODE PACKAGE MANAGER (npm) ---------------------lecture 197 {package installation and use of packages}
it is a place that collect modules  where people have build for node ,it created by github organisation. 
npm packages search in google ,we this only when we install.


---package.json comes from npm but effectvely act as a configuration file our project
