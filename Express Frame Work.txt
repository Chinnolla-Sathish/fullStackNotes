Express Frame Work

-- it is a framework on top of the node 
-- Express is a javascript framework that allows us to create backends.
-- node is Screwdiver javaScript is screw Express is a electric Screwdriver it a very fast and quick.


Whats the backend ?

--A sever is a computer or big computer is would on 24/7 , it serve the requests made by http or https it search for the html,css and javascrript files.
-- A server consists of an application and database. The application listens the user requests made.



-----------------------SIX STEPS TO CREATE AN EXPRESS SERVER---------------------------------
1.Create directory
2.Create index.js file
3.initialise NPM
4.install the Express package
5.Write Server application in index.js
6.Start server

--ports are basically doors of the server
each port is identified by a unique number

in command line 

mkdir "Foldername" --- create a new directory or new Folder
touch index.js ---- create a new file in the directory or new folder [but it is not working in my computer ]



--------------------------------------------- HTTP ------------------------------------
-- hyper text transfer protocol(http)
	--decribes a language , the language that allows computer to talk to each other across the internet.

^^^^^^^^^^ HTTP Request vocabulary ^^^^^^^^^^
--GET  --> Request a resource from a server or database
--POST --> Sending Resource to server or database
--PUT  --> Replace the resource 
--PATCH  -->patch up a resurce 
--DELETE  --> delete the resource form the sever or database

put and patch are little bit similar they update the resourse in sever put(replace the resource completly) and patch(patch up the resource)

----------------- for all this method experments you need to install a postman in you system[lecture 203]-------------


^^^^^^^^nodemon^^^^^^^^^
--nodemon --> it automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

syntax: in command line instead of entering node index.js just enter nodemon index.js

before it mustbe installed
npm i -g nodemon (here g stands for global)

---------------------------------------PACKAGES-------------------------------------

--express - it is a framework and a package in the node.js
installation:
	npm install express
--nodemon[ it will auto save whenever there is any change in the file]
installation
npm install -g nodemon (here g stands for global)
--body-parser [middleware -> used for preprocess the request]
installation
	npm install body-parser
--morgan [ used for log the request]
installation:
	npm install morgan

---------------------------STANDARD STATUS RESPONSE CODE -------------------------------

--informational responses(100-199)
--Successful responses(200-299)
--Redirection messages(300-399)
--Client error responses(400-499) // 404 error is also one of this http standard status response code
--server error responses(500 - 599)

// you will find the details of each number in : developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status.












-----------------------------------------------EXPRESS MIDDLEWARES------------------------------- 

-- The man in the middle. Using body-parser together with HTML forms

--what does the middleware do?
	
	--> it preprocess the request --[body-parser middleware is used for processing]
	-->it logging the reqests before actually processed [most commonlu used logging middlewares for node.jsis a package called morgan]
	-->We can also use middle for authentication
	--> identify and handle the errors before they go through to the handlers
	-->Body-parser -->it a example of middleware --> it is basically used to handle form data.

^^^^^^^^^ Morgan Package ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 - it log the request that come into the server
 - morgan is triggered before any http methods trigged, it give the log details like date and time , type of request, url of the request, status code of the request.

predefined formats used with morgan: combined,common,dev,short,tiny


******* next() method and bodyparser paly a important role in express ******************
******** res.sendFile() it is basicallya sending a static file *******************
